# Replication Programs for "The Inner Bueaty of Firms"

"The Inner Beauty of Firms" is my job market paper, and is available [here](https://www.jkohlhepp.com/files/kohlhepp_jmp.pdf). This repository contains the code necessary to replicate the paper. I currently do not have authorization to share the raw data publicly, but I hope to at some point share an intermediate version of the data.
